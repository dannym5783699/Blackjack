Creating a basic trading bot involves several steps, from setting up your development environment to deploying your bot. This guide outlines a simplified approach to building a basic trading bot in Haskell, suitable for a beginner. The bot will implement a simple trading strategy: buy when the stock price is lower than a certain threshold and sell when it's higher than another threshold. This project will introduce you to Haskell's way of handling HTTP requests, JSON, and interacting with a trading platform's API.

### Step 1: Environment Setup
1. **Install Haskell**: Ensure you have the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) and the Haskell build tool, Stack, installed on your computer.
2. **Choose an IDE or Editor**: You can use an integrated development environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA with the Haskell plugin or a text editor such as Visual Studio Code with Haskell extensions.

### Step 2: Project Initialization
1. **Create a New Project**: Use Stack to create a new Haskell project. In your terminal, run `stack new trading-bot simple`.
2. **Navigate to Your Project**: Change directory to your newly created project folder, `cd trading-bot`.

### Step 3: Add Dependencies
1. **Edit `trading-bot.cabal`**: Add necessary dependencies for HTTP requests (`http-conduit`), JSON parsing (`aeson`), and any other libraries you might need.
2. **Update and Build**: Run `stack build` to download and compile your dependencies.

### Step 4: API Integration
1. **Choose a Trading Platform**: Select a trading platform that offers a public API for stock trading. For educational purposes, find one that also offers a sandbox or a demo environment.
2. **API Keys**: Register on the platform and obtain API keys for authentication.
3. **Explore the API**: Understand how to authenticate, fetch stock prices, place orders, and check your portfolio through the API documentation.

### Step 5: Implementing Core Functionality
1. **Fetch Stock Prices**: Write a function to make HTTP GET requests to fetch current stock prices using the platform's API.
2. **Parsing JSON**: Implement a function to parse the JSON response from the API into a Haskell data structure.
3. **Authentication**: Code the functionality to authenticate your requests with the API keys you obtained.

### Step 6: Trading Strategy
1. **Define Strategy**: For simplicity, define threshold-based rules for buying and selling a specific stock.
2. **Trade Execution**: Write functions to execute buy or sell orders based on your strategy's criteria.
3. **Safety Checks**: Implement basic safety checks to avoid placing orders under undesirable conditions (e.g., not enough balance).

### Step 7: Main Logic
1. **Scheduling**: Decide how often your bot should check stock prices and make trading decisions. You can use a simple loop with a delay for this.
2. **Integration**: Bring together your functions for fetching prices, making decisions, and executing trades within your main logic.
3. **Logging**: Add logging for important events (e.g., trade executions) to monitor the bot's activity.

### Step 8: Testing
1. **Sandbox Environment**: Test your bot in a simulated environment provided by your trading platform to ensure it behaves as expected without risking real money.
2. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for individual components of your bot (e.g., JSON parsing, decision-making logic).

### Step 9: Deployment
1. **Review Code**: Ensure your bot is working correctly and efficiently. Check for any hard-coded values or sensitive information in your code.
2. **Deployment Environment**: Decide on a deployment environment. You can run your bot on a cloud server, a home server, or even a Raspberry Pi.
3. **Continuous Running**: Set up your bot to run continuously or according to the schedule you've decided on.

### Step 10: Monitoring and Maintenance
1. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on the trading decisions and performance of your bot. You might want to set up alerts for significant events or errors.
2. **Update and Refine**: As you learn more and gather data, refine your trading strategy and update your bot's logic.

This project will deepen your understanding of Haskell and introduce you to algorithmic trading concepts. Remember, trading involves risk, especially with algorithmic trading, where mistakes can be costly. Always test thoroughly in a simulated environment before using real money.
